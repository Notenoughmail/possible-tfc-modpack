# Images
 - Retextures of gunswithoutroses items are completely made by me
 - Double ingot textures are taken from IE, as are the lead, electrum, constantan, and treated woods in kubejs/assests/tfc/textures/block/metal/full
 - The rest of the images in metal/full are from TFC
 - All lead ore blocks and items are recolours of TFC's equivalent gold ores
 - The leather pouch is a lightly edited copy of Tool Belt's tool pouch
 - The capacitor frame tops are lightly edited copies of IE's capacitor tops
 - The brazier edit is a mix of TFC and Create assets
